          Progress Made
        </h2>
        <p class="font-light text-gray-900 text-xl mb-4">
          During this week we went over the idea of what exactly an attic ventilation 
          system is and why it is important for regulating temperatures inside a home.
          Marlon, who is the person who came up with the idea explained it very well and
          we became more convinced that it could be a sucessful product if actually 
          executed correctly. The idea is that we have a smart attic ventilation system
          which uses a PCB to control the attic fans and the PCB also has internet 
          and bluetooth capabilties so that we can have a web app that controls the 
          attic fan through the PCB.

          <li>Researched what an attic ventilation system is</li>
          <li>

            and implementation issues 
          </li>
          <li>
            Marlon cleared any doubts we might have had with the idea as his idea
            was very flushed out and many broad details were covered well

          Issues Faced and Challenges
        </h2>
        <p class="font-light text-gray-900 text-xl mb-4">
          There were some issues that we had initially with this idea, specifically 
          the feasibility of the ideas Marlon presented such as the idea that we 
          are relying on working with existing companies already established in 
          the attic vent space. We were thinking that these ideas presented were
          more features than a full product if anything as we are simply adding
          onto an exsting product. But we thought about it more and figured that
          our idea can be a full featured product if we make it a hardware and 
          software integration to existing attic fans. In this way, we've added
          something that is more than a feature but a reinvention of how attic fans
          should operate.

          <li>Feasibility and practicality issues of our product </li>
          <li>Distinguishing our idea from a feature or a product</li>
          <li>Some doubts we had whether the idea was a compelling idea that 
            other ventilation companies would invest in themselves, we thought
            about this idea was probably already thought about by companies adding
            may have been overlooked for whatever reason such as expenses.
