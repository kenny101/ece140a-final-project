          Progress Made
        </h2>
        <p class="font-light text-gray-900 text-xl mb-4">
          During this week we began brainstorming and researching the
          feasibility of our product through statistical research and conducting
          analysis through tools we learned in class such as SWOT analysis which
          analyzes what other companies have to offer and what opportunies can
          be had to incorporate into our product. We also began interviewing
          people we knew that fit this product niche. In this case, our product
          niche were general homeowners. We interviewed them by asking them
          their knowledge of attic vents as it was important that our customers
          would be knowledgable enough about attic fans in order for them to be
          convinced that they needed our product.

            Interviewed our customer product niche to determine practicality and
            desirability of features of out product or whether or not anything
            additional needed to be added to make our product better or more
            profitable.

          Issues Faced and Challenges
        </h2>
        <p class="font-light text-gray-900 text-xl mb-4">
          Some issues we faced included lack of knowledge in the manufacturing
          place as we did not have any clue as to how PCBs were made in
          factories, how we would plan to build or implement it, and what
          software was needed to accomplish this. Along with this complication
          was the cost of the materials required to build the product. This was
          important as the cost of the materials, labor, and other cost
          logistics has a significant weigh on the success of our product.
