          Progress Made
        </h2>
        <p class="font-light text-gray-900 text-xl mb-4">
          This was the final week of our report and we had figured out many 
          logistics such as competition, target market, problems to be solved, etc.
          We looked into our competition and came up with two companies that were
          very well established in this market which were QuietCool and AirVent. 
          QuietCool was a company which was already integrating IoT into their devices
          which was an issue with this as our product aimed to solve similar problems
          which QuietCool aimed to solve which was to make attic ventilation more 
          efficient by saving energy, thereby saving costs and lowering carbon emissions.
          However, their product lacked something that we thought was really important 
          which was that it did not take into account forecast and other external
          factors required to operate efficiently. Users would have to manually set threshhold
          values to turn on/off the attic vent if they wanted it to operate more efficiently.
          We came up with an idea to have our product be plug and play so that the user does
          not need to worry about their attic vents operating or relying on their knowledge to set
          threshhold values for the attic vents.

          Issues Faced and Challenges
        </h2>
        <p class="font-light text-gray-900 text-xl mb-4">
          One major challnge we faced was that one of our teammates Jeremiah had left 
          the class which left only three of us to complete the report. Jeremiah was
          valuable to the team as he offered insights as to how feasible our product was 
          by presenting questions we did not think of and solutions to how we would go 
          about implementing our product. We also had scheduling issues as we had finals
          soon and many of us had not started on the final project for this class.
